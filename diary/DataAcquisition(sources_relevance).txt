I obtained the dataset from data.gov under the title “State Drug Utilization Data 2025.” 
The dataset is published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. 
The metadata indicates that it was updated on December 12, 2025 and is publicly available under a public domain license.

The dataset contains state-level records of covered outpatient drug utilization paid for by state Medicaid agencies. 
It includes National Drug Code identifiers, drug name, number of prescriptions, units reimbursed, total amount reimbursed, Medicaid amount reimbursed, 
and non-Medicaid amount reimbursed.

I selected this dataset because it provides administrative reimbursement data at the state and quarterly level, 
which directly supports my research question on interstate price variation for identical drugs. 

The inclusion of NDC allows me to compare the same drug across states and across time.
The dataset is publicly accessible and reproducible via data.gov. I documented the dataset URL and access date in the README file. 
The CSV file was stored in the data/raw/ directory without modification..

The dataset includes both year and quarter variables, enabling longitudinal panel analysis. 
I verified that the dataset contains sufficient cross-state and temporal variation to support my problem formulation.
