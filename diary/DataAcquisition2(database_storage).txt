I stored the State Drug Utilization CSV into a local SQLite database so I can query it like a real dataset instead of repeatedly working from a flat file. 
The database file is named medicaid_drugs.db. 

I created two tables: drug and utilization. 

The drug table is my reference table and it stores one row per unique NDC, with columns ndc (primary key), labeler_code, product_code, package_size, and product_name. 

The utilization table stores the actual quarterly state records and includes utilization_id (primary key), ndc (foreign key referencing drug.ndc), utilization_type, state, year,
 quarter, suppression_used, units_reimbursed, number_of_prescriptions, total_amount_reimbursed, medicaid_amount_reimbursed, and non_medicaid_amount_reimbursed. 

The relationship is one-to-many, meaning one drug entry in drug can appear in many utilization rows across states and quarters. I also created indexes on utilization.ndc and (state, year, quarter) so joins and time or location queries run faster. After building the schema, I inserted unique NDC rows into drug first, then inserted the full utilization records into utilization to keep referential integrity clean.
