

I decided to focus on the State Drug Utilization Data because it provides structured, transaction-level Medicaid reimbursement data that allows me to study real pharmaceutical market behavior across states.
My core research question is whether states systematically pay different reimbursement prices for the same drug and whether those differences persist over time.
I want to understand if certain states consistently appear as higher price or lower price markets for identical drugs.

The analysis is grounded in reasoning related to bargaining power, market structure, and manufacturer pricing behavior in regulated markets.




Input

The inputs for this analysis include state, year, quarter, National Drug Code (NDC), labeler code, total reimbursement amount, Medicaid reimbursement amount, non-Medicaid reimbursement amount, number of prescriptions, units reimbursed, and suppression flag.

These variables allow me to compare identical drugs across states and across time.
I will exclude suppressed rows and zero-prescription records when calculating prices to ensure meaningful comparisons.
The NDC serves as the unique identifier for comparing the same drug across markets.

The dataset structure allows me to treat each state and quarter combination as a separate market observation.

Output

The primary output variable will be price per prescription, calculated using total reimbursement divided by number of prescriptions.

I will analyze how this value varies across states for identical NDCs.
A secondary output will be measures of price dispersion across states in the same quarter.
I want to examine whether price differences persist across multiple quarters for the same drug.

The focus is on identifying patterns in observable reimbursement behavior rather than estimating underlying cost structures.


Time Horizon

The time horizon will span all available years in the dataset to allow for quarterly panel analysis.

Using multiple quarters enables me to examine whether interstate price differences persist over time or converge.
